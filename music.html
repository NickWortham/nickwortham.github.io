        <h1>Inspiration 10</h1>
        <p>Just a little journey down Disco Road, not too long so as to wear you out but long enough to satisfy all of her wants & needs ... a hip fling to reconnect things we thought we lost between the frost of her cold, broken heart. Rest in peace, my friend. Something funky to help bring us back to life! Remember the movement of Spirit through the Void; remember Being; remember the sound of your Soul! & Post your favorite track in the comments if you get bored. One consciousness permeates everything. One spark generated all energy. One law binds all force.</p>

Several professional studios as well as a prestigious cosmetology school (which I was blessed to represent) were involved; Congratulations to Amanda, Lezlie, Katrina, and all of the other talented individuals at MarinelloBeautySchool for taking 1ST PLACE in Round One on March 7! Go team!</p>

Instead, remember! May the truth of our ancestry and our shared bond as a sentient species bring us closer together, that one day we shall DANCE IN PEACE with all humankind!</p>

        <p>Well, it's that time of year again, the time of year when we ... start a new year? Holiday food & fun for all, many blessings abound - happy Winter Solstice, Jesus! This was a delay, there was a pause; reverberation was involved. Just when we thought we knew what we wanted! A sentimental farewell in the heart of shopping season? Everybody calm down, I'm not going anywhere - even if I disappear for awhile, you know I'll always be around. In your hearts. In your minds. Like Christ. Christlike. Okay, that's enough religious tom foolery for one trimester - I'm dodging lightning already as it is! Enjoy the sounds, people.</p>

        <h1>Fishin' 4 Bass</h1>
        <p>Due to popular demand, I have decided to upload an old Dub mix that I recorded in early 2012 as road trip music for the journey to Lightning in a Bottle Festival. It's bass, bass, bass, baby, so crank up the sub freaqs and nod ya head like ya know! I lost or deleted the track list at some point, so biters are just going to have to taste the flavors that Google can serve you. So sorry! And p.s. I recorded this mix using VirtualDJ before I made the switch to Traktor, so blame that for any sound quality issues... Without further ado, let's go FISHIN'!!</p>

        <p>Good God! I just realized this is only the second mix I have uploaded all year. I'm sorry for leaving you hungry little babies & birdies! Got a good serving of some sweet lovin' to keep your tummies rubbin' mmm hmm mm. Running up the tempo and switching up the style is the name of the game this time.</p>

It's A Dogs Life. Every Dog Has Its Day. Deep down minimal town with a splash of trance thrown around is what we are serving up this time - low tempo, slow, do not pass go.</p>

        <p>So long, so long... and hello! It feels like it is almost fall time, but DON'T FRET party children! There will still be plenty of summer heat left to go around I'd wager. And I DO wager... still sore about that 50 bucks (thanks for nothing '49ers!) Vegas life, eh? This time I broke it down a little bit for ya'll; something funky something fresh. It's a little bit jive in this beehive tonight!</p>

        <h1>Drum iN Face</h1>
        <p>Hello, fans! I am addressing the chirping noises and rotating ceiling-mounted air-moving mechanisms in my apartment, of course. I know it's been awhile since you have heard from your Dreamer (me!), and I apologize - sometimes life gets complicated. There hath been bottled lightning, un-televised drama and NSA incursions, yet here we stand again united as always! This one is an old one, one to fill the void. My first DnB set - beginner's luck? Recorded awhile ago using *ahem* VDJ, I still vouch for the quality of this mix. For anyone who has ever been lost, loved, or lonely - this is for you</p>

        <h1>Inspiration #4 (Erly Berd Werms)</h1>
        <p>So I had this night owl experience, found a motor speedway, and wound up at an Electric Daisy Carnival... there were lights and sounds and lots of pretty people. Like Benjamin Franklin once said, "I pray you have as much fun listening to this mix as I did recording it." Such a quotable guy!</p>

        <p>My, my, how time flies! Look, there, in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane, it's - another DJ set from $andman! *huzzah huzzah* and the crowd goes wild! This time I brought the real deal Shaquille O'Neal oatmeal cereal: trance to minimal, with some weird bass at the end for you high heads. EDC 2013 is coming up quick! Everybody bring your glow sticks and hundred dollar bills to Las Vegas at the end of June, because it's going DOWN. Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, get on up... IT'S SUMMERTIME!!! :-D</p>

        <p>Well here we are again! Welcome and welcome back friends, to another inspired amalgamation of innervating aural frequencies. Days have come and gone, yet still we find ourselves together… ya'll ready for a cooker this summer? I need a promo shirt that reads: "Will Play Pool Parties for Fun" Downtown. Minimalist. Supreme. These are the words that come to mind as I reflect upon our second session, soon to be blown into the winds of the past along with the rest of this present known universe. Stay loved everybody!</p>

Always live, never planned, this is how I mix during my gigs - ebbing and flowing as a sonic stream. Yell at me if I don't keep this series somewhat fresh!</p>
